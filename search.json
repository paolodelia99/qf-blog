    "text": "In this notebook, we take on the role of a trader working on an investment bank’s exotic options desk, focusing on FX derivatives. We will explore how such traders hedge their books and how the portfolio’s value and Greek exposures change as the underlying market parameters evolve. To keep things simple, we assume the underlying follows a geometric Brownian motion, with flat term structures for both the volatility surface and the domestic and foreign interest rates. This places us in a Black-Scholes framework (specifically the BS-extended model for FX options, the Garman-Kohlhagen model), described by the following dynamics under the risk-neutral measure:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ndS_t &= (r_d - r_f) S_t \\, dt + \\sigma S_t \\, dW_t^d, \\\\\ndB^d_t &= r_d B^d_t\\, dt, \\\\\ndB^f_t &= r_f B^f_t\\, dt\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe investments banks are said to be on the “sell-side”, which basically means that they facilitate transactions between institutions, and provide access to financial markets. In our case we are manifacturing exotics options for our clients, who are seeking market opportunities. This leaves the trader with a significant exposition, as the bank take the opposite side of client trades. To manage the risk and ensure the bank meet its obligations when options are exercised, the trader must hedge against market movements.\nThe hedging of exotics does not only involves hedging first order greeks (the \\(\\Delta\\) and the \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)), but its involves hedging high order greeks like \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(Vanna\\) (DvolDspot) and \\(Volga\\) (DvegaDvol). Another completixity when hedging exotics option, especially when dealing with binary or barriers, pin risks needs to be taken into account when the barrier is hit.\nThe library we use for option pricing is QuantLib, the largest open-source quantitative finance library available. QuantLib offers a comprehensive suite of tools for modeling, pricing, and risk management of financial derivatives. Its active community and extensive documentation make it a popular choice among both practitioners and researchers in the field."

Once the deal is closed, given the level of FX spot rate and the IV agreed upon, the strike will be set at a level yielding the BS Delta the two counterparties were dealing. This way of quoting is smart: it allows us not to worry about small movements of the underlying during the bargaining process, because the absolute strike will be defined only after the agreement on the price, so that the trader is sure to trade an option with given features in terms of exposures both to the underlying asset and to the implied volatility.\nThe most liquid FX optios are usually the 25-\\(\\Delta\\) calls and put and the ATM calls and puts, thus those are going to be our basic hedging instruments and the strikes that we are going to refer to for the exotic in our book.\nHere is an example on how FX volatility are quoted:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(10\\Delta p\\)\n\\(25\\Delta p\\)\n\\(35\\Delta p\\)\nATM\n\\(35\\Delta c\\)\n\\(25\\Delta c\\)\n\\(10\\Delta c\\)\n\n\n\n\n1W\n11.96%\n11.69%\n11.67%\n11.75%\n11.94%\n12.19%\n12.93%\n\n\n2W\n11.81%\n11.54%\n11.52%\n11.60%\n11.79%\n12.04%\n12.78%\n\n\n1M\n11.60%\n11.39%\n11.39%\n11.50%\n11.72%\n11.99%\n12.77%\n\n\n2M\n11.43%\n11.16%\n11.15%\n11.25%\n11.48%\n11.76%\n12.60%\n\n\n3M\n11.22%\n10.92%\n10.90%\n11.00%\n11.23%\n11.52%\n12.39%\n\n\n6M\n11.12%\n10.78%\n10.76%\n10.87%\n11.12%\n11.43%\n12.39%\n\n\n9M\n11.04%\n10.72%\n10.71%\n10.83%\n11.09%\n11.41%\n12.39%\n\n\n1Y\n11.00%\n10.69%\n10.68%\n10.80%\n11.06%\n11.39%\n12.38%\n\n\n2Y\n11.02%\n10.63%\n10.60%\n10.70%\n10.94%\n11.28%\n12.34%\n\n\n\nTo get the strike from the Delta-Vol quote QuantLib comes in handy with a BlackDeltaCalculator that from a given delta (and option type, discount factor, spot value, and delta-vol quote value) it returns the strike associated with it.\n\ncall_barrier_factory = FxBarrierOptionFactory(spot_handle, ql.Option.Call)\nput_barrier_factory = FxBarrierOptionFactory(spot_handle, ql.Option.Put)\nput_vanilla_factory = FxVanillaOptionFactory(spot_handle, expiration_date, ql.Option.Put)\ncall_vanilla_factory = FxVanillaOptionFactory(spot_handle, expiration_date, ql.Option.Call)\ndelta_call_calc = ql.BlackDeltaCalculator(\n    ql.Option.Call, \n    ql.DeltaVolQuote.Spot, \n    EUR_USD, \n    eur_curve.discount(expiration_time), \n    usd_curve.discount(expiration_time), \n    np.sqrt(black_vol.blackVariance(expiration_time, EUR_USD)))\ndelta_put_calc = ql.BlackDeltaCalculator(\n    ql.Option.Put, \n    ql.DeltaVolQuote.Spot, \n    EUR_USD, \n    eur_curve.discount(expiration_time), \n    usd_curve.discount(expiration_time), \n    np.sqrt(black_vol.blackVariance(expiration_time, EUR_USD)))\n\n# Get the strikes equivalent for the 0.25 delta for call and put options\nd25_call_strike = delta_call_calc.strikeFromDelta(0.25)\nd25_put_strike = delta_put_calc.strikeFromDelta(-0.25)\natm_strike = delta_call_calc.atmStrike(ql.DeltaVolQuote.AtmDeltaNeutral)\n\nThe model that extends the Black-Scholes model when dealing with FX options is the Garman-Kohlhagen model, whose dynamics have been defined above.

    "text": "Hedging the book\nNow that we have set up the trader portfolio, we need to find the optimal hedge for that portfolio that is going to minimize the sensitivities that we want not be exposed to. Usually a trader sitting in a exotic desk will not just keep low exposure to the classical greeks like \\(\\Delta\\), \\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\mathcal{V}\\), but also in some higher order Greeks live DVegaDvol (a.k.a. \\(Volga\\)) and the DVegaDSpot (a.k.a. \\(Vanna\\)).\nThis need comes from the fact that in case of exotics (especially for barrier and binaries) the “barrier” risks needs to be hedged: as spot moves closer to the barrier, vega can spike, that’s vanna risk.\nThe most common way to hedge those greeks in the FX option market is by using simple structure that can be obtained by \\(25 \\Delta\\) calls and puts and ATM calls and puts. Here’s the basic structures that will compose our hedging portfolio:\n\nSpot: to oviously to hedge the \\(\\Delta\\)\nATM straddles: involves buying an ATM vanilla call and ATM vanilla put, this structure provides positive gamma and positive vega\nRR (Risks reversals): involves buying an \\(25 \\Delta\\) vanilla call and sell a \\(25 \\Delta\\) vanilla put, provides a strong vanna exposure (becuase calls and puts respond differently as spot moves)\nButterflies: involves buying an \\(25 \\Delta\\) vanilla call and sell a \\(25 \\Delta\\) vanilla put and selling twice a straddle, provides a strong volga exposure.\n\n\nHedge methodology\nThe way we are going to find the optimal weights of our hedging portfolio is by using the classical parameter hedging methodology. Which mathematically means to set up a linear system where:\nThe exposure vector is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\Delta \\\\ \\Gamma \\\\ \\text{Vega} \\\\ \\text{Vanna} \\\\ \\text{Volga} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nwhich represent the total exposure of our portfolio (the weighted sum of each instrument greek in our exotic portfolio). For each hedge instrument \\(j\\) (spot, ATM straddle, RR, BF), compute its greek vector \\(\\mathbf{h}_j\\). Form the hedge matrix:\n\\[\nH = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{h}_1 & \\mathbf{h}_2 & \\dots & \\mathbf{h}_n \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThen solve for weights \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (position sizes):\n\\[\nH \\mathbf{x} - E  \\approx 0.\n\\]\nIn our case the exposure vector is bigger than the hedging vector \\(x\\), since we only 4 instruments and 5 greeks to hedge. We end up with a linear system with 4 variables and 5 equations, thus there is not an exact solution, but we can find a solution that minimized the sum of residual squares.\nWhen we want to calculate the greeks of our portfolio, we want to do it in meaningful way, thus this requires to us to set the shift operator in a way that makes sense to measure the specific risk of our porfolio. The two main ways that industry professional do that is by using 1% of the spot change and 1% vol change.\n\nspot_change = 0.01 * spot_quote.value() / 2\nvol_change = 0.01 / 2\n\ndelta_book = sum([pos.sensitivity(delta, h=spot_change) for pos in book])\nvega_book = sum([pos.sensitivity(vega, h=vol_change) for pos in book])\nvolga_book = sum([pos.sensitivity(volga, h=vol_change) for pos in book])\ngamma_book = sum([pos.sensitivity(gamma, h=spot_change) for pos in book])\nvanna_book = sum([pos.sensitivity(vanna, h=spot_change, k=vol_change) for pos in book])\n\nThe raw Greek exposition for our book is then the following:\n\n\nBook Delta exposure: 371644.134787602\nBook Gamma exposure: 13330632.102691187\nBook Vega exposure: 1183872.580309415\nBook Volga exposure: 380633.56067277736\nBook Vanna exposure: 190025.47439962075\n\n\nIn FX, Greeks can be confusing, because they depend on the quotation of the currency pair as well as the currency in which they are calculated. Furthermore, premium can be included or excluded, smile-effect can be included or not included, and numerical approximations may further add to the confusion.\nWhat traders use in real life are a “modified version” of the plain greeks:\n\nThe plain \\(\\Delta\\) of a forex option gives the amount of Foreing currency a trader would have to buy in the spot-market to delta-hedge a sold-option. To get the amount of dollars to buy those EURs (in our case) we need to multiply the delta by the current spot value.\nTraders’ \\(\\Gamma\\): where the spot in the finite diff method is varied by 0.5% and then multiplied by 1%, since traders consider the change of delta as spot changes relatively by 1%.\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma^{tr}_t = \\Gamma_t \\frac{S_t}{100}\n\\]\n\nTraders’ \\(\\mathcal{V}\\): A trader will typically consider vega as the change of the USD or EUR value of a derivative contract (or a book of derivatives) assuming a 1% absolute/constant change in volatility.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{V(\\sigma + 0.5\\%) - V(\\sigma - 0.5\\%)}{1\\%} \\cdot 1\\%\n\\]\n\n\nBook Delta exposure: $438540.0790493703\nBook Gamma exposure: $157301.458811756\nBook Vega exposure: $11838.72580309415\nBook Volga exposure: $3806.3356067277737\nBook Vanna exposure: $2242.300597915525\n\n\nAs you might guess the exposition is negative since we are on the sell-side of the trade, thus we need to buy the hedging structures to hedge ourselves from those greeks.\nOur exposure vector \\(E = [ \\Delta, \\Gamma, \\mathcal{V}, Volga, Vanna ]\\) is:\n\n# Greek exposure vector\nE = np.array([delta_book, gamma_book, vega_book, volga_book, vanna_book])\nE\n\narray([  371644.1347876 , 13330632.10269119,  1183872.58030942,\n         380633.56067278,   190025.47439962])\n\n\nFor each of the base instrument (Spot, ATM call, ATM put, \\(25\\Delta\\) call and \\(25\\Delta\\) put) let’s calculate the basic greeks.\n\n# hedge_matrix\nbase_notional = np.float64(1_000_000)\nspot_greeks = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) * base_notional\natm_call_greeks = np.array([\n    delta(atm_call, h=spot_change),\n    gamma(atm_call, h=spot_change),\n    vega(atm_call, h=vol_change),\n    volga(atm_call, h=vol_change),\n    vanna(atm_call, h=spot_change, k=vol_change),\n]) * base_notional\natm_put_greeks = np.array([\n    delta(atm_put, h=spot_change),\n    gamma(atm_put, h=spot_change),\n    vega(atm_put, h=vol_change),\n    volga(atm_put, h=vol_change),\n    vanna(atm_put, h=spot_change, k=vol_change),\n]) * base_notional\ndelta25_call_greeks = np.array([\n    delta(delta25_call, h=spot_change),\n    gamma(delta25_call, h=spot_change),\n    vega(delta25_call, h=vol_change),\n    volga(delta25_call, h=vol_change),\n    vanna(delta25_call, h=spot_change, k=vol_change),\n]) * base_notional\ndelta25_put_greeks = np.array([\n    delta(delta25_put, h=spot_change),\n    gamma(delta25_put, h=spot_change),\n    vega(delta25_put, h=vol_change),\n    volga(delta25_put, h=vol_change),\n    vanna(delta25_put, h=spot_change, k=vol_change),\n]) * base_notional\n\nFrom there let’s calculate the greek exposure for the strcutures that we are going to use in out hedging portfolio, and then create our Hedge Matrix:\n\\[\nH = \\left[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n    & \\text{Spot} & \\text{Straddle} & \\text{RR} & \\text{Butterfly} \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\Delta   & h_{11} & h_{12} & h_{13} & h_{14} \\\\\n    \\Gamma   & h_{21} & h_{22} & h_{23} & h_{24} \\\\\n    \\text{Vega}   & h_{31} & h_{32} & h_{33} & h_{34} \\\\\n    \\text{Volga}  & h_{41} & h_{42} & h_{43} & h_{44} \\\\\n    \\text{Vanna}  & h_{51} & h_{52} & h_{53} & h_{54} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\]\n\n# Let's create the straddle, RR, Butterfly from the base vanilla options\natm_straddle = atm_call_greeks + atm_put_greeks\nrr = delta25_call_greeks - delta25_put_greeks\nbutterfly = delta25_call_greeks + delta25_put_greeks - 2 * atm_straddle\n\n# Hedge Matrix\nH = np.stack([spot_greeks, atm_straddle, rr, butterfly]).T\n\nSince our system have more equations than variables, we must use a least square method (provided by np.linalg.lstsq) to solve it. Least square method minimizes the Euclidian 2-norm $ || E - Hx || $.\n\nx, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(H, E)\n\nNow that we have a solution let’s see what’s our remaining exposure to each of the choosen hedged greeks. We do that by\n\\[\nH x - E\n\\]\n\nresidual_greeks = (H @ x - E).tolist()\n\nprint(f\"Residual Delta exposure: ${residual_greeks[0] * spot_quote.value()}\")\nprint(f\"Residual Gamma exposure: ${residual_greeks[1] * 0.01 * spot_quote.value()}\")\nprint(f\"Residual Vega exposure: ${residual_greeks[2] * 0.01}\")\nprint(f\"Residual Volga exposure: ${residual_greeks[3] * 0.01}\")\nprint(f\"Residual Vanna exposure: ${residual_greeks[4] * spot_quote.value() * 0.01}\")\n\nResidual Delta exposure: $-2.6100315153598783e-09\nResidual Gamma exposure: $-13.422826034608855\nResidual Vega exposure: $126.72764540341916\nResidual Volga exposure: $0.016476123058237136\nResidual Vanna exposure: $-0.09291220850032404\n\n\nAnother crucial thing when hedging a book is, of course, to measure the P&L from one rebalancing period to another. Let’s then calculate the value of the various components of our hedging portfolio. We have the the P&L from time \\(t\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nP\\&L_{t \\rightarrow t + 1} = (V_{t + 1}^{book} + V_{t + 1}^{hedge} + C_{t + 1}) - (V_{t}^{book} + V_{t}^{hedge} + C_{t})\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(V_{t}^{book}\\) is the value of our book at time \\(t\\), which is the sum of the premiums that we’ve been collected\n\\(V_{t}^{hedge}\\) is the value of the hedging portfolio, the sum of the premium of the structures that we have bought to hedge our from the various sensistivies\n\\(C_t\\) the cash/bank account of our portfolio which includes financing of cash and trade cashflows\n\nA shorter way to express the P&L, is just by considering the variation of the value of the book + the variation of the value of the hedges + cost of borrowing + interest accrued:\n\\[\nP\\&L_{t \\rightarrow t + 1} = \\delta V_{t, t + 1}^{book} + \\delta V_{t, t + 1}^{hedge} + \\text{cost of borrowing} + \\text{interest accrued}\n\\]\nsince the rebalancing of the hedges of the bank account happend at the end of trading day.\n\nspot_premium_eur = x[0] * base_notional\nspot_premium_usd = x[0] * base_notional * spot_quote.value()\natm_straddle_premium = atm_call.NPV() + atm_put.NPV() * base_notional * x[1]\nrr_premium = delta25_call.NPV() - delta25_put.NPV() * base_notional * x[2]\nbutterfly_premium = (delta25_call.NPV() + delta25_put.NPV() - 2 * (atm_call.NPV() + atm_put.NPV())) * x[3] * base_notional\n\nThe usd borrowed (which is the sum of the premiums of or hedging instrument) is crucial for use to calculate the interest accrued for borrowing the usd dollars to buy the hedging structures.\n\nhedging_str_premium = atm_straddle_premium + rr_premium + butterfly_premium + spot_premium_usd\nhedging_str_premium\n\nnp.float64(4182631.052146415)\n\n\nThus the value of the cash at time \\(t = 0\\) is the equal to all the cash that we’ve borrowed to build the hedging structures plus the premiums that we’ve been collected from selling the exotics options\n\nbank_account_value = - hedging_str_premium + np.sum(premiums)\nbank_account_value\n\nnp.float64(-4099629.5308762337)\n\n\n\nport_value = [hedging_str_premium - np.sum(premiums) + bank_account_value]\n\nprint(f\"The portfolio value at time t = 0 is {port_value[0]}\")\n\nThe portfolio value at time t = 0 is 0.0"
